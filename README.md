# BX-Options

Manifest URL: https://github.com/justinthejaguar/BX-Options/releases/latest/download/module.json

This is a Foundry VTT compendium which incorporates the classes of BX Options by Erin D. Smale. These classes merely touch the surface of the class creation rules that Erin has put together. I encourage players to get their hands on this great book, and find your own enjoyment in the options presented.
You can find BX Options here: https://welshpiper.com/packages/bx-options-class-builder/

Classes Included:
The Elven Archon, Assassin, Barbarian, Bard, Beast-talker, Berserker, Crusader, Elven Elder, Necromancer, Scout, Shaman, Sorcerer, and the Halfing Warden.

Each has its own abilities and journal entry for progression contained.

For any questions on the module reach out on Discord to: Jaguar#8265

Additionally, I'd like to make sure to mention the contributors below for the workflow that I use for this module: https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/FoundryVTT-Module-Template/graphs/contributors
